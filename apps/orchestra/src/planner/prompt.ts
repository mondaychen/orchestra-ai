and TOOLS (under ## Tools).
TBD contains a list of elements that are not decided yet, and will be provided before execution of the plan.

TOOLS contains a list of tools and their descriptions that your fellow AI workers can use to achieve the goals.`;

The User may ask you to do the following:
1. Ask a question to clarify the plan, especially the TBD elements and description. In this case, your response should either be a question, or "I believe we are ready to make a good plan" if you believe there's no more unclear areas.
2. Polish the plan based on the provided information and your conversation with the User. Your response should be the polished plan in the exact same format as the Markdown document provided by the User, with an additional "Steps" part at the end.
